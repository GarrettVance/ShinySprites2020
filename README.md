# ShinySprites2020
Contemporary reworking of cg_ShinySprites, the 2007 classic NVIDIA OpenGL sample. 
ShinySprites2020 is a complete C++ solution for Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and builds an OpenGL console application. 
I found the process of modernizing the old 2007 NVIDIA sample a surprisingly entertaining way of 
touring some forgotten OpenGL history. Highlights of the journey include assembly language shaders, register
combiners, the NVIDIA cg programming framework, and the dreaded nvparse utility.
